## Phalanx Automation Extensions

Compliance for most organizations is a burden from a people and resource perspective, but we've tried to alleviate this pain by supporting automation with third party vendors via APIs and automated evidence gathering.

## Development

### Create repo tarball

To create a tarball and send to the extension engine, reference the [test image build script](https://github.com/Risk3sixty-Labs/phalanx-extensions/blob/master/testBuildImage.sh).

```sh
$ tar -czf repo.tgz $REPO_DIR -C $REPO_DIR .
```
